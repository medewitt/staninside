Description: This package provides helper functions that can be used for integrating Stan code driven
    by the CmdStanR package. Using CmdStanR and pre-written Stan code can make
    package installation easy and less prone to fail because it removes the 
    need for Rcpp and RStan packages(and their dependencies). Using CmdStanR
    will also afford users the opportunity to use the latest developments
    within CmdStan. However, building these packages requires some work and this
    package provides tools to assist with that,
